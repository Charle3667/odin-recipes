    <h3>Glorious Korean Beef</h3>
    <p>
      There seems to be a notion that food bloggers enjoy lavish home cooked
      meals 3 meals a day, 7 days a week. After all, we cook for a living,
      <em>right</em>? But in reality, at least for me, I’m constantly eating out
      during the week. Jason and I rotate between In-N-Out, Chipotle, or sushi
      dinners right at home because at the end of a full work day at the office,
      I can’t lift a finger in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s when this Korean beef bowl comes in. It’s seriously one of the
      easiest recipes I have ever made. The cooking process itself takes just
      about <strong>10-15 minutes</strong>, and if you have some leftover cooked
      rice, you’ll have dinner on the table before you know it!
