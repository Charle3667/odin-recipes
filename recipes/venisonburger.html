            <h3>The <em>Perfect</em> Venison Burger</h3>
            <p><em>Ah, venison burgers.</em> A popular dish to make with 
                ground deer meat, but they often end up dry, 
                tough and gamey.</p>
            <p>If you find that this is usually true for you, 
                you’re probably cooking venison burgers like you’re 
                cooking beef burgers. With just a few simple tricks, 
                you can take your wild game burger night to the <strong>next 
                    level</strong> and start using up that ground venison you have 
                in the freezer. </p>
            <p>Venison burgers are always a go-to in our house 
                year-round when we’re trying to use up ground 
                venison, and these honestly are so crazy flavorful 
                and juicy, I like them even more than traditional 
                beef or turkey burgers. The best part is the <em>lean, 
                grass-fed, responsibly sourced protein.</em></p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb. ground venison</li>
                <li>2 tsp. balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. onion powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. pepper</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp. freezing cold butter, grated*</li>
                <li>Burger buns (brioche is best and toppings you like – cheese (we like Pepper or Colby Jack), lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, etc. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Before beginning, place a stick of butter in the freezer.</li>
                <li>If you’re cooking your burgers on a grill, go ahead and preheat the grill to medium-high (450-500F). If you’re cooking on a stovetop, get out a large pan (preferably cast-iron) and set it on the appropriate burner. You’re going to want to heat the pan for 3-5 minutes before cooking, so keep that in mind. </li>
                <li>Mix together the venison, balsamic, Worchestershire, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. I like to use a fork and my hands. It’s good to use a fork to “fluff” and break up the meat, you don’t want it too packed. </li>
                <li>Right before you form the patties, grate in about 2 tablespoons of freezing cold butter (I use a regular, old cheese grater). Mix again quickly just to distribute, but not so much that the butter melts. </li>
                <li>Form the meat into 4 evenly sized balls and then shape them into patties. Form a divot in the top of the burgers to help catch some of the juice. </li>
                <li>Place the burgers on the grill or in the hot pan, and cook for anywhere from 5-8 minutes per side. I like to just flip the burgers once so they have a nice crust. If you’re using cheese, add your cheese when you flip your burger over.</li>
                <li>I use an internal read thermometer and pull my burgers at 140-145F (medium) but you can pull them at 150F-160F if you like yours more well done. </li>
                <li>Let your burgers rest for 5-10 minutes <strong>(SERIOUSLY)</strong> before assembling and eating. <em>Voila!</em></li>
            </ol>
